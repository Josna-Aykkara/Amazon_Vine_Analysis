## Summary

**The summary of the analysis** - Based on the analysis the paid Vine’s received a 38.24% of 5-star reviews compared to the non-Vine review of 54.47%. As a result, we can conclude that there is no bias between the 5-star reviewers for both the Vine and non-Vine.

**An additional analysis is recommended to support the statement** -An additional analysis of the 1-star and 2-star review is required to evaluate if there is any bias between the Vine and non-Vine customers. It would also enlighten us to compare the customer satisfaction based on the percentage of 1-star and 2-star customer reviews.
